== Installation ==

= Install YARPP from within WordPress =

1. Visit the plugins page within your WordPress dashboard and select `Add New`
1. Search for `YARPP`
1. Press "Install Now" for the `YARPP` plugin
1. Activate YARPP from your Plugins page
1. Go to the "YARPP" settings page to customize YARPP
1. *[optional]* copy the sample YARPP Custom Template files inside the `yarpp-templates` folder into your active theme folder.

= Install YARPP Manually =

1. Upload the `yet-another-related-posts-plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate YARPP from your Plugins page
1. Go to the "YARPP" settings page to customize YARPP
1. *[optional]* copy the sample YARPP Custom Template files inside the `yarpp-templates` folder into your active theme folder.

= Install YARPP with the WP-CLI =

1. `wp plugin install yet-another-related-posts-plugin --activate`
1. Go to the "YARPP" settings page to customize YARPP
1. *[optional]* copy the sample YARPP Custom Template files inside the `yarpp-templates` folder into your active theme folder.

The *YARPP custom template* feature allows you to easily customize look and feel using the same coding conventions and [Template Tags](https://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags) as in WordPress themes.

Your YARPP Custom Template file must be in the *active theme's main directory* in order to be recognized by YARPP. If your theme did not ship with a YARPP templates, move the files in the `yarpp-templates` directory which ships with YARPP into your active theme's main directory. Be sure to move the *files* (which must be named `yarpp-template-`...`.php`) to your theme, not the entire directory. There is no limit restriction on custom templates.


= After Activation =

You should customize your Pool, Algorithm and Automatic Display Options settings from the YARPP settings page. YARPP supports a full range of placement options, including Automatic Display Options (pick where to show YARPP from the YARPP settings page), Block, Shortcode, Widget, YARPP functions() and REST API support. Details below.

= Automatic Display Options =

Configurable from the YARPP settings page, the *Automatic Display Option* automatically displays YARPP right below post content. You can configure which posts types to display YARPP on from the YARPP settings page.

If you do not want to show the Related Posts display in its default position (right below the post content), first go to YARPP options and turn off the "Automatic Display Options".

If you would like to instead display it in your sidebar and you have a widget-aware theme, YARPP provides a Related Posts widget which you can add under "Appearance" > "Widgets."

If you would like to add Related Posts elsewhere (such as inline related posts), edit your relevant theme file (most likely something like `single.php`) and add the shortcode code `[yarpp]` or PHP function `yarpp_related();` within [The Loop](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop) where you want to display the related posts. Make sure you don't add `echo yarpp_related();` or you may end up with duplicates in your related posts section. The YARPP Block is also an option.

= Automatic Display in Feed Options =

Make sure the "display related posts in feeds" option is turned on if you would like to show related posts in your RSS and Atom feeds. The "display related posts in feeds" option can be used regardless of whether you auto display them on your website (and vice versa).

= Block =

YARPP ships with full support for Gutenberg Blocks. You can place YARPP's Block manually wherever you’d like in post content.

= Shortcode =

You can place YARPP's related posts manually wherever you’d like in post content or theme files.

To add to post content, use the shortcode:

`[yarpp]` to show content related to the current post. You may use more than one YARPP shortcode in a given post or template.

All the parameters accepted by `yarpp_related()` (see below) can also be used in the shortcode. Here are some examples...

If you know the reference Post ID that you want to show content related to, use:

`[yarpp reference_id=123]` to show content related to post 123

To specify which YARPP template to use, use the "template" attribute like so:

`[yarpp template="yarpp-template-photoblog"]` - where `yarpp-template-photoblog.php` is the file name of the custom template
`[yarpp template="list"]` - built-in "List" template
`[yarpp template="thumbnails"]` - built-in "Thumbnails" template

To specify maximum number of posts to show, use the "limit" attribute like so:

`[yarpp template="list" limit=3]`

To only show recent posts, use the "recent" attribute (provide it with a number, a space, and then either "day", "week" or "month")

`[yarpp recent="6 month"]`

To show another post type, use the "post_type" parameter.

`
[yarpp post_type="page"]
`

If you need to provide multiple values (eg posts and pages, or a list of categorires of posts to exlude), separate them with a comma but no space.
`
[yarpp post_type="post,page"] - include both posts and pages in results
[yarpp exclude="1,2,3"] - exclude posts with categories with IDs 1,2 and 3
`

To adjust the weights and taxonomy requirements, provide the value as JSON (using the same structure as for `yarpp_related()` below). Eg

`
[yarpp weight='{"body":1}'] - only consider body content
[yarpp weight='{"body":2,"title":2,"tax":{"category":0, "post_tag":0}}'] - give extra weight to bodies and titles, but none to categories
[yarpp require_tax='{"category": 2, "post_tag": 0}'] - require at least one category in common
`

To add YARPP shortcode to your theme files (eg. single.php), use:

`<?php echo do_shortcode('[yarpp]'); ?>`
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[yarpp reference_id=123]'); ?>`

If you're adding the shortcode *outside [the loop](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop)*, you must provide the reference_id.

= Widget =

Related posts can also be displayed as a widget. Go to the Appearance > Widgets options page and add the "Related Posts (YARPP)" widget. Choose to display content from YARPP Basic. The widget will only be displayed on single entry (permalink) pages.

The YARPP widget can be used even if the "auto display" option is turned off.

= REST API =

Add related posts to your JavaScript driven app!

YARPP adds a REST API endpoint for fetching related posts. The JSON results from the REST API query are the same as you would see if you were visiting a post on your website (the same quantity and order). It is possible to override the quantity at the time of making the REST API request.

[[Documentation](https://support.shareaholic.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046456752)]

= YARPP functions() =

Developers can call YARPP's powerful relatedness algorithm from anywhere in their own code. Some examples and more details are in this [WordCamp Birmingham talk](https://www.slideshare.net/mitcho/relate-all-the-things).

You may use the functions defined in `includes/related_functions.php` in your own code, notably:

1. `yarpp_related()` - gets the HTML for related posts and displays it
1. `yarpp_related_exist()` - checks whether any related posts exists
1. `yarpp_get_related()` - returns the list of related posts (`WP_Post` objects)

*Examples:*

Show related posts, using all the settings set on the YARPP settings page:

`<?php yarpp_related(); ?>`

Each of these functions will default to using the settings set on the YARPP settings page, but can be customized. For example:

<code>
yarpp_related(
  array(
    // Pool options: these determine the "pool" of entities which are considered
    'post_type' => array('post', 'page', 'wc_product', ...), //  post types to include in results
    'show_pass_post' => true, // show password-protected posts
    'show_sticky_posts' => true, // show sticky posts
    'past_only' => true, // show only posts which were published before the reference post
    'exclude' => array(), // a list of term_taxonomy_ids. entities with any of these terms will be excluded from consideration.
    'recent' => false, // to limit to entries published recently, set to like '15 day', '20 week', or '12 month' (https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-interval/)
    
    // Relatedness algorithm options: these determine how "relatedness" is computed
    // Weights are used to construct the "match score" between candidates and the reference post
    'weight' => array(
      'body' => 1,
      'title' => 2, // larger weights mean this criteria will be weighted more heavily
      'tax' => array(
        'post_tag' => 1,
        ... // put any taxonomies you want to consider here with their weights
      )
    ),
    // Specify taxonomies and a number here to require that a certain number be shared:
    'require_tax' => array(
      'post_tag' => 1 // for example, this requires all results to have at least one 'post_tag' in common
    ),
    // The threshold which must be met by the "match score" to be considered related
    'threshold' => 5,
    
    // Display options:
    'template' => 'thumbnails', // which theme/custom template to use. Built-in ones include "list" and "thumbnails", or the name of a YARPP template file in your active theme folder starting with "yarpp-template-". Example: yarpp-template-videos or yarpp-template-videos.php
    'limit' => 5, // maximum number of results
    'order' => 'score DESC', // column on "wp_posts" to order by, then a space, and whether to order in ascending ("ASC") or descending ("DESC") order
    'promote_yarpp' => true, // boolean indicating whether to add 'Powered by YARPP' below related posts
    'generate_missing_thumbnails' => true, // automatically generate missing thumbnail sizes on the fly
    'extra_css_class' => 'class_1 class_2', // add CSS classes to YARPP's parent div
  ),
 $reference_ID, // second argument: (optional) the post ID. If not included, will use the current post.
 true // third argument: (optional) true to echo the HTML block; false to return it
);
</code>

Options which are not specified will default to those specified on the YARPP settings page. Additionally, if you are using a builtin template rather than specifying a custom template file in `template`, the following arguments can be used to override the various parts of the builtin template: `before_title`, `after_title`, `before_post`, `after_post`, `before_related`, `after_related`, `no_results`, `excerpt_length`.

If you need to implement related entries programmatically or to know whether they exist, you can use the functions:

1. `yarpp_get_related( $args, $reference_ID )`
Returns an array of `post` objects, just like the WordPress function `get_posts`.
1. `yarpp_related_exist( $args, $reference_ID )`
Returns a boolean for whether any such related entries exist.

For each of these functions, `$args` takes the same arguments as those detailed for `yarpp_related()` above, except for the various display and template options.

Note that at this time custom YARPP queries using the functions mentioned here are *not* cached in the built-in YARPP caching system. Thus, if you notice any performance hits, you may need to write your own code to cache the results.

Example of how to use a custom YARPP query and cache the results for a day:

<code>
$result = get_transient('yarpp_custom_results_for_' . $post->ID);
if(! $result){
  $result = yarpp_related(['post_type' => 'reply'],null,false);
  set_transient('yarpp_custom_results_for_' . $post->ID, $result, DAY_IN_SECONDS);
}
echo $result;
</code>

Show at most 4 related WooCommerce products based on their title and especially on their categories, assuming custom YARPP template
`yarpp-related-wc-products.php` has been added to the active theme folder:

<code>
yarpp_related(
  array(
    'limit' => 4,
    'weight' => array(
      'title' => 1,
      'tax' => array(
        'category' => 2
      )
    ),
    'post_type' => 'wc_product',
    'template' => 'yarpp-related-wc-products.php'
  )
);
</code>

Check for posts related to post with ID 123, and loop through them in order to do some more custom logic:

<code>
$related_posts = yarpp_get_related(array(), 123);
if(! $related_posts){
  echo 'No related posts';
} else {
  foreach($related_posts as $post){
    // $post is a WP_Post object.
    echo $post->post_title;
  }
}
</code>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If your question isn't here, ask your own question at [the WordPress.org forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yet-another-related-posts-plugin).

= Many pages list "no related posts." =

Most likely you have "no related posts" right now because the default "match threshold" is too high. Here's what we recommend to find an appropriate match threshold: lower your match threshold in the YARPP "Algorithm" options to something very low, like 1. (If you don't see the match threshold, you may need to display the "Algorithm" options via the "Screen Options" tab at the top.) Most likely the really low threshold will pull up many posts that aren't actually related (false positives), so look at some of your posts' related posts and their match scores. This will help you find an appropriate threshold. You want it lower than what you have now, but high enough so it doesn't have many false positives.

= How can I limit related posts to a certain time frame? For instance, I don't want to show posts from two years ago. =

In Wordpress, go to "Settings" and "Related Posts (YARPP)" and make sure "The Pool" is checked in the "Screen Options" section at the top of the page.  In "The Pool" section, check the box next to "Show only posts from the past *X* months."

= Where do I tell YARPP to display related posts only by tags? =

In WordPress, go to "Settings" and "YARPP" and make sure "Algorithm" is checked in the "Screen Options" section at the top of the page.  In the "Algorithm" section, configure the dropdown boxes next to "Titles," "Bodies," "Categories," and "Tags."

= Can I manually specify related posts? =

Sorry, but specifying related posts, displaying related posts from external WordPress sites, and pulling content from the Comments section are all outside the scope of YARPP at this time.

= I'm seeing related posts displayed on the home page. How do I prevent that? =

Some WordPress themes treat the home page as an archive or a "page." Go to "Settings" then "Related Posts (YARPP)" and view the "Automatic Display Options" section. Make sure "Pages" and "Also display in archives" are not checked.

= How can I prevent the "related posts" list from displaying on specific posts? =

**Option 1:**

On the edit post page, uncheck “Display Related Posts” in the YARPP box. Be sure to update or publish to save your changes.

**Option 2:**

Add `<!--noyarpp-->` to the HTML code of any post to prevent related posts from displaying.

**Option 3:**

Use the `noyarpp` filter. For example:

<code>
// Disable YARPP Automatic Display in specific categories
function yarpp_disable_categories() {
  // Examples of in_category usage: https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/in_category
  if ( in_category( array( 'my_category_1_slug', 'my_category_2_slug' ) ) ) {
    return true;
  }
}
add_filter( 'noyarpp', 'yarpp_disable_categories' );
</code>

These solutions only work if you are using "Automatic Display" in the "Display Options" section. If you are programatically calling `yarpp_related()`, the shortcode `[yarpp]` from PHP code or the YARPP Block, you will need to do your own conditional checks.

= I'm using the Thumbnails display in YARPP 4+. How do I override the style of the text that displays? The title only shows two lines, the font is larger than I'd like, I'd like to center the thumbnails, etc. =

If you're familiar with CSS, you can override any YARPP styles by editing your theme's `style.css` file, or any other CSS file you may have created that loads after the YARPP one. To edit your theme's CSS file, go to "Appearance" then "Editor" and then click `style.css` in the right sidebar. Add changes at the bottom of the file and click "Save." If you do edit this file, just make sure you add `!important` after each style declaration, to make sure they'll override the YARPP rules.

Some common overrides that YARPP users have added are:

<code>
/* Reduces the title font size and displays more than two title lines */
.yarpp-thumbnail {height: 200px !important;}
.yarpp-thumbnail-title {font-size:0.8em !important; max-height: 4em !important}

/* Centers the thumbnail section */
.yarpp-related-widget {text-align:center !important;}
</code>

Once you save any CSS changes, empty your browser's cache and reload your page to see the effect.

= How do I remove sold out WooCommerce products from recommendations (and otherwise filter by postmeta)? = 
If you use YARPP to show related products and want to exclude products that are sold out, use the following code snippet:

<code>
function yarpp_custom_wp_query($query) {
    if(isset($query->yarpp_cache_type)){
        $query->set('post_type', 'product');
        $meta_query = [
            'relation' => 'AND',
            [
                'key' => '_stock_status',
                'value' => ['instock','onbackorder'],
                'compare' => 'IN',
            ]
        ];
        $query->set('meta_query', $meta_query);
    }

    return $query;
}
add_filter('pre_get_posts', 'yarpp_custom_wp_query', 100);
</code>

Note: this filter applies after the related items were already calculated, so when it filters out an item you will see fewer related items than you requested.

You can similarly [filter WordPress' meta queries](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_meta_query/) to include/excluded posts from YARPP's related results.

= I'm using the Thumbnails display. How can I change the thumbnail size? =

As of YARPP v5.19.0, YARPP usually defaults to using WordPress' default thumbnail size. This can be changed to another thumbnail size using the YARPP setting "Thumbnail Size".

However, if you used YARPP before v5.19.0, or your theme defines a "yarpp-thumbnail" size, the default is the "yarpp-thumbnail". To change "yarpp-thumbnail" size, add the following to your theme's `functions.php` file with appropriate width and height variables:

`add_image_size( 'yarpp-thumbnail', $width, $height, true );` 

When you do this, make sure you also set the YARPP setting "Thumbnail Size" to "yarpp-thumbnail".

Each time you change YARPP's thumbnail dimensions like this, you will probably want to have WordPress regenerate appropriate sized thumbnails for all of your images. We highly recommend the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin for this purpose.

Note: if you don't use YARPP's thumbnail size, you might want to avoid generating it for newly uploaded images to save space. To do that add the following code snippet to your theme's `functions.php` file:

`add_filter( 'yarpp_add_image_size', "__return_false" );`

= I'm using the Thumbnails display. Why aren't the right size thumbnails being served? =

By default, if an appropriately sized thumbnail is not available in WordPress, a larger image will be served and will be made to fit in the thumbnail space via CSS. Sometimes this means images will be scaled down in a weird way, so it is not ideal. What you really want is for YARPP to serve appropriately-sized thumbnails.

There are two options for doing so:

* First, you can use the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin to generate all these thumbnail-sized images in a batch process. This puts you in control of when this resizing process happens on your server (which is good because it can be processor-intensive). New images which are uploaded to WordPress should automatically get the appropriate thumbnail generated when the image is uploaded.

* Second, you can turn on a feature in YARPP to auto-generate appropriate size thumbnails on the fly, if they have not yet been created. Doing this type of processing on the fly does not scale well, so this feature is turned off by default. But if you run a smaller site with less traffic, it may work for you. Simply add `define('YARPP_GENERATE_THUMBNAILS', true);` to your theme's `functions.php` file.

= I'm using the Thumbnails display. Why are some of my posts missing appropriate images? =

YARPP's thumbnail view requires that a WordPress "featured image" be set for each post. If you have many posts that never had a featured image set, we recommend the plugin [Auto Post Thumbnail](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/auto-post-thumbnail/), which will generate post thumbnails for you.

= Is YARPP compatible with WordPress Multisite? =

YARPP should work fine in a multisite environment, and many users are running it without any issues using WordPress Multisite. It will, however, only get results *within* each blog. It will not display related posts results from across your network.

= I want to use YARPP on a site with content in multiple languages. =

The recommended solution in such cases is to use the [Polylang](https://polylang.wordpress.com/) plugin. Polylang has posted [a tutorial for using YARPP with Polylang](https://polylang.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/polylang-and-yarpp/).

= Does YARPP work with full-width characters or languages that don't use spaces between words? =

YARPP works fine with full-width (double-byte) characters, assuming your WordPress database is set up with Unicode support. 99% of the time, if you're able to write blog posts with full-width characters and they're displayed correctly, YARPP will work on your blog.

However, YARPP does have difficulty with languages that don't place spaces between words (Chinese, Japanese, etc.). For these languages, the "consider body" and "consider titles" options in the "Algorithm options" may not be very helpful. Using only tags and categories may work better for these languages.

= Does YARPP slow down my blog/server? =

YARPP is a highly optimized plugin with an inbuilt cache that makes subsequent queries super efficient. This means that YARPP will not slow your site down.

If you are running a large site and need to throttle YARPP's computation, try the official [YARPP Experiments](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yarpp-experiments/) plugin which adds this throttling functionality.

= Are there any plugins that are incompatible with YARPP? =

* [SEO_Pager plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/267966): turn off the automatic display option in SEO Pager and instead add the code manually.
* Other related posts plugins, obviously, may also be incompatible.

Please submit similar bugs by starting a new thread on [the WordPress.org forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/yet-another-related-posts-plugin). We check the forums regularly and will try to release a quick bugfix.

= YARPP seems to be broken since I upgraded to WordPress X.X. =

Before upgrading to a new WordPress version, you should first deactivate all plugins, then upgrade your WordPress, and then reactivate your plugins. Even then, you may still find that something went wrong with your YARPP functionality. If so, try these steps:

1. Visit the "YARPP" settings page to verify your settings.
2. Deactivate YARPP, replace the YARPP files on the server with a fresh copy of the new version, and then reactivate it.
3. From the "YARPP" settings page, flush the YARPP cache

= Can I clear my cache? Can I build up the cache manually? =

Yes, there is a button to clear YARPP's cache table in YARPP's WP Admin options.

= How to add support for a Custom Post Type (CPT)? =

To make YARPP support your Custom Post Type (CPT), the attribute `yarpp_support` must be set to true when the CPT is registered. The CPT will then be available in the YARPP settings page.

`'yarpp_support' => true`

For example:

<code>
function register_my_cpt() {
  $args = array(
    'public' => true,
    'label'  => 'Books',
    'yarpp_support' => true,
  );
  register_post_type( 'book', $args );
}
add_action( 'init', 'register_my_cpt' );
</code>

If you do not have access to the code which is registering the CPT, maybe because it is a third-party plugin that is creating it, you can still add the `yarpp_support` argument:

<code>
/**
 * Filter the CPT to register more options
 *
 * @param $args       array    The original CPT args.
 * @param $post_type  string   The CPT slug.
 *
 * @return array
 */
function add_yarpp_support_to_post_types( $args, $post_type ) {

  // If not our target CPT, exit.
  if ( 'my_custom_post_type' !== $post_type ) {
    return $args;
  }

  // Add additional YARPP support option.
  $cpt_args = array(
    'yarpp_support' => true
  );

  // Merge args together.
  return array_merge( $args, $cpt_args );
}
add_filter( 'register_post_type_args', 'add_yarpp_support_to_post_types', 10, 2 );
</code>

*You should replace `my_custom_post_type` with the CPT that you need to add YARPP support to and add this code to the `functions.php` of your theme.*

If you would like to programmatically control which post types are considered in an automatically-displayed related posts display, use the `yarpp_map_post_types` filter.

= Does YARPP support custom taxonomies? =

Yes. Any taxonomy, including custom taxonomies, may be specified in the `weight` or `require_tax` arguments in a custom display as above. `term_taxonomy_id` specified in the `exclude` argument may be of any taxonomy.

If you would like to choose custom taxonomies to choose in the YARPP settings UI, either to exclude certain terms or to consider them in the relatedness formula via the UI, the taxonomy must (a) have either the `show_ui` or `yarpp_support` attribute set to true and (b) must apply to either the post types `post` or `page` or both.

= Can I disable the Review Notice forever? =

If you want to prevent the Review Notice from appearing you can use the function below:

<code>
/**
 * Disable YARPP Review Notice
 *
 */
function yarpp_disable_review_notice() {
  remove_action('admin_notices', array('YARPP_Admin', 'display_review_notice'));
}
add_action('admin_init', 'yarpp_disable_review_notice', 11);
</code>

= Can I disable the request-for-feedback modal when deactivating the plugin? =
Sure. Use the following code:

<code>
add_action(
  'admin_init',
  function(){
    remove_all_filters('shareaholic_deactivate_feedback_form_plugins');
  },
  11
);
</code>

= I removed the YARPP plugin but I still see YARPP-related database tables. Shouldn't those be removed, too? =

Beginning with version 4.0.7, YARPP includes clean uninstall functionality. If you no longer wish to use YARPP, first deactivate YARPP using the "Plugins" page in WordPress, then click the "Delete" link found on the same page. This process will automatically remove all YARPP-related files, including temp tables. If you manually try to remove YARPP files instead of going through WordPress, some files or temp tables could remain.

After a bit of a hiatus, we're back! The plugin had been delisted due to a minor [email address issue](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2018/10/22/reminder-plugins-are-closed-if-emails-bounce/). This has been resolved with this release and the plugin has been reinstated. We consider this to be a big step, and yes, after a 6-month hiatus of not being in the plugin directory.🙂

The plugin is also no longer maintained by Adknowledge. A group of us with **deep expertise in Content Recommendations** and **10+ years experience with maintaining very popular plugins** have very recently taken Yarpp over from Adknowlege. More on this will be shared very soon.

After a break of many years, the plugin is 100% supported now that the baton has been passed on. A larger update (hand-in-hand with proper communication) is being carefully worked on with a focus on a host of bug fixes and compatibility updates which will be available once it is properly tested, ready and updates properly communicated. Stay tuned.❤️

= 4.0.8 =
* The recent 4.0.7 YARPP update included a settings modification to opt in users to our tracking pixel by default. By doing so, our intent was to use this expanded information to better understand the geographic reach of the popular plugin. We have been made aware that this change infringed upon the WordPress guidelines. We apologize for the issue and have remedied the situation in update 4.0.8. Going forward, we would really appreciate your input to help us continue to improve the product. We are primarily looking for country, domain, and date installed information. Please help us make YARPP better by opting in to this information and by filling out our quick, [5 question survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Z278L88). Thank you.

= 4.0.7 =
* [Bugfix](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/orderby-error): Now more robust against certain custom options.

* Added Macedonian (`mk_MK`) localization by WPdiscounts.

= 4.0.6 =

* More robust activation handling, particularly when network-activated.
* Improved handling of exceptions, for example when fulltext indexes cannot be created or non-MyISAM tables are used.
* YARPP no longer triggers the generation of YARPP-thumbnail-sized images (120x120) when YARPP thumbnails are not used.
	* If you are using YARPP programmatically and using the thumbnails view and having troubles with YARPP's thumbnail size being registered, a manual control to force image size registration has been added to the [YARPP Experiments](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yarpp-experiments/) plugin.
* [Bugfix](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yarpp_related_exist-and-begin_yarpp_time-error): calls to `yarpp_related_exist()` type functions were causing errors.
* Bundled `yarpp-template-wpml.php` is now called `yarpp-template-multilingual.php`, following [discussion with the author of the Polylang plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/better-integration-of-yarpp-and-polylang).

* Bugfix: on sites where custom templates are not available, the "thumbnails" display option would get reset when visiting the YARPP settings page
* [Bugfix](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yarpp-css-is-delayed-or-doesnt-load): the CSS for YARPP's thumbnails display would load at the foot of the page, and therefore would cause some style-flashing. This is fixed for automatic includes, but not for widgets or manual calls.
* Restoration of the `$post` global after YARPP is now more robust. Fixes the display of incorrect metadata on some complex themes.
* YARPP template files no longer recognize `Template Name` fields in their headers, instead using `YARPP Template`. This is to avoid confusion with regular page templates.

	* Code to generate thumbnails of appropriate size on the fly has been added, but is turned off by default for performance reasons (see FAQ)
* Bugfix: a class of `yarpp-related-` with a stray hyphen was sometimes being produced. Now fixed so it produces `yarpp-related`.
* [Bugfix](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bug-in-sql-function-in-yarpp_cache): `term_relationships` table was being joined when unnecessary
* [Bugfix](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-option-to-add-widget-title-in-theme-using-hybrid-core-framework): widget options would not display if custom templates were not available
* Bugfix: some transients expired too soon if object caching was used
* The `yarpp_map_post_types` filter now also applies to feeds and takes an extra argument to know whether the context is `website` or `rss`.

	* All YARPP output is now wrapped in a `div` with class `yarpp-related`, `yarpp-related-widget`, or `yarpp-related-rss` as appropriate ([by request](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/adding-a-main-div-to-default-template)). If there are no results, a `yarpp-related-none` class is added.
	* The "related posts brought to you by YARPP" text is only added if there were results.
* Refinements to settings UI:
	* A new design for the template chooser
	* Example code display is now hidden by default; turn them back on from the "screen options" tab.
	* A new "copy templates" button allows one-button installation of bundled templates into the current theme, if filesystem permissions make it possible.
	* Header information in YARPP custom templates are now displayed to users in the settings UI. Available fields are `YARPP Template`, `Description`, `Author`, `Author URI`, in the same format as plugin and theme file headers. See bundled templates for examples.
* Code cleanup:
	* Settings screen UI have been rewritten to use `div`s rather than `table`s!
	* Inline help in settings screen now use WordPress pointers
	* Removed keyword cache table, as it does not ctually improve performance much and the overhead of an additional table is not worth it.
* Default option changes:
	* Default result count is now 4
	* Default match threshold is now 4
	* Default for "before related entries" heading uses `h3` instead of `p`
* Added `yarpp_map_post_types` filter to programmatically specify what post types should be looked at for automatic displays

  * Previously, the cache would never actually build up properly. This is now fixed. Thanks to Artefact for pointing this out.
  * The appropriate caches are cleared after posts are deleted ([#1245](http://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/1245)).
  * Caching is no longer performed while batch-importing posts.
* A new object-based abstraction for the caching system. YARPP by default uses custom database tables (same behavior as 3.1.x), but you now have an option to use the `postmeta` table instead. To use `postmeta` caching, add `define('YARPP_CACHE_TYPE', 'postmeta');` to your `wp-config.php` file.<!--YARPP no longer uses custom tables! Both custom tables (`yarpp_related_cache` and `yarpp_keywords_cache`) are automatically removed if you have them. WordPress Post Meta is used instead for caching.-->
